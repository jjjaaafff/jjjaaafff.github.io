I'm a Master's student in Information and Communication Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, mentored by Professor [Ya Zhang](http://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/). 


I earned my Bachelor's degree from the IEEE honored class (Computer Science direction) at SJTU, where I worked with Dr. Linfeng Cao and Prof. Nanyang Ye.

<!-- > **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP for Fall 2024.** -->

My research interests include computer vision, AI for medicine, especially the anomaly detection.
