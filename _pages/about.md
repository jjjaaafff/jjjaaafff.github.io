I am a Master's student in Information and Communication Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, mentored by Professor [Ya Zhang](http://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/). 


I earned my Bachelor's degree from the [IEEE Pilot Class](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm) (Computer Science direction) at SJTU, where I worked with Dr. Linfeng Cao and Prof. [Nanyang Ye](https://ynysjtu.github.io/).

I am currently a research intern in [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) for Intelligent Healthcare

My research interests include computer vision, AI for medicine, especially the anomaly detection.
