I'm a Master's student in Information and Communication Engineering at [SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), mentored by Professor [Ya Zhang](http://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/).

I earned my Bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University, where I worked with Dr. [Chong Wang](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2935.htm) and Prof. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang), and collaborated with Prof. [Maya Daneva](https://people.utwente.nl/m.daneva) and [Marten J. van Sinderen](https://people.utwente.nl/m.j.vansinderen) at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.

> **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP for Fall 2024.**

My research interests center around **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a particular focus on the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My key research areas include:

- ðŸŒŸ **Commonsense/Symbolic Reasoning in LLMs**: Enhancing the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by improving their commonsense knowledge and symbolic reasoning abilities.
- ðŸ”§ **Autonomous Tool Usage by LLMs**: Developing mechanisms that enable LLMs to autonomously use tools, expanding their problem-solving capabilities.
- ðŸ¤– **LLMs as Intelligent Agents**: Using LLMs as intelligent agents to facilitate user interactions and provide assistance across various domains.
- ðŸ“‹ **Evaluation of LLMs**: Assessing the capabilities, limitations, and practical applications of LLMs to ensure their efficacy and reliability in real-world scenarios.

I prefer **simplicity and unity** in methods. I'm deeply interested in the **strengths and limitations of LLMs** and particularly value their **real-world applications**, such as helping marginalized communities and individuals with disabilities.
