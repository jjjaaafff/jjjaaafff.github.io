I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), mentored by Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). I am also working closely with Professor [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) from UC San Diego and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from the UC Davis (previously at University of Southern California).

I earned my Bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University, where I worked with Dr. [Chong Wang](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2935.htm) and Prof. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang), and collaborated with Prof. [Maya Daneva](https://people.utwente.nl/m.daneva) and [Marten J. van Sinderen](https://people.utwente.nl/m.j.vansinderen) at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.

> **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP for Fall 2024.**

My research interests center around **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a particular focus on the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My key research areas include:

- 🌟 **Commonsense/Symbolic Reasoning in LLMs**: Enhancing the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by improving their commonsense knowledge and symbolic reasoning abilities.
- 🔧 **Autonomous Tool Usage by LLMs**: Developing mechanisms that enable LLMs to autonomously use tools, expanding their problem-solving capabilities.
- 🤖 **LLMs as Intelligent Agents**: Using LLMs as intelligent agents to facilitate user interactions and provide assistance across various domains.
- 📋 **Evaluation of LLMs**: Assessing the capabilities, limitations, and practical applications of LLMs to ensure their efficacy and reliability in real-world scenarios.

I prefer **simplicity and unity** in methods. I'm deeply interested in the **strengths and limitations of LLMs** and particularly value their **real-world applications**, such as helping marginalized communities and individuals with disabilities.

> A quick note 📝: I’ve lived with stuttering since childhood and sometimes struggle to express myself clearly/smoothly 😮‍💨. Your patience and understanding during our chat would mean the world to me 😇. Feel free to use `they/them` or `he/him` pronouns for me, I'm open to both 🤗.
